=============================
Hyscore, a functional library
=============================

Hyscore is a library written in Hy adding functional programming support to
Hy. It's foremost just an excuse for me to write code in Hy.

Yes, it's vaguely influeneced by `underscore.js <http://underscorejs.org/>`
hence the (bad) pun.
